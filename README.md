# Rule-Engine-with-AST
To implement a rule engine using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in Python, we can break the problem into a few key components:

1. AST Representation: Create a tree-like structure where each node represents a logical or arithmetic operation, condition, or value. The nodes will combine to form rules.

2. Node Evaluation: Define how each type of node should be evaluated (e.g., boolean expressions, comparisons, and arithmetic).

3. Rule Definition: Allow users to define rules based on attributes (age, department, etc.) and generate corresponding ASTs.

4. Dynamic Rule Combination: Allow rules to be combined, modified, or expanded dynamically.

FEATURES:
1. Dynamic Rule Creation: Create complex rules and store them as AST structures.
2. Rule Combination: Combine multiple rules into a single AST efficiently.
3. Rule Evaluation: Evaluate rules against user data (e.g., age, department) to determine eligibility.
4. AST Modification: Modify existing ASTs by adding or removing conditions.
5. Database Integration: Uses SQLite to store rules and their ASTs.
6. Error Handling: Handles invalid rules, invalid data formats, and other errors gracefully.

PREREQUISITE:

1.Installation of Python 3.8

2.Pip Installment 

Dependency:

1.we have to import sqlite3 and json

2.we have to import re(regex)
   
we  have to download the module using command like:

pip install -r requriement.txt

CONCLUSION:

This project is a 3-tier rule engine application designed to evaluate user eligibility based on various attributes such as age, department, income, and spending. The system uses an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent conditional rules, allowing dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules. The application consists of a simple UI, API, and backend storage using SQLite for rule persistence.
